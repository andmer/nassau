# Nassau

Nassau implements NASDAQ transport protocols on the JVM.

You can use Nassau to connect to [Nasdaq][], [EBS][], [SIX Swiss Exchange][],
and other network endpoints that use NASDAQ transport protocols. You can also
use it to provide your own services using these protocols.

  [EBS]: http://ebs.com
  [SIX Swiss Exchange]: http://six-swiss-exchange.com

Nassau is designed to exhibit low and predictable latency. To achieve this, it
supports non-blocking, zero-copy networking and does not allocate any memory
on message reception or transmission. The SoupBinTCP implementation can
achieve [4.8 Âµs round-trip time (RTT)](tests/soupbintcp-perf-test) over the
loopback interface.

Nassau requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or newer.

## Protocols

Nassau implements the following protocols:

- **NASDAQ SoupBinTCP 3.00**: a reliable transport protocol for applications
  requiring delivery of delimited, sequenced messages between two endpoints.

- **NASDAQ MoldUDP64 1.00**: a reliable transport protocol for applications
  requiring delivery of delimited, sequenced messages from one sender to many
  receivers.

- **NASDAQ BinaryFILE 1.00**: a file format for storing delimited messages.

See the [Wiki][] for links to the protocol specifications.

Modules
-------

Nassau contains the following libraries:

- [**Core**](libraries/core) implements the NASDAQ transport protocols.

- [**Utilities**](libraries/util) contains utility methods for working with
  NASDAQ transport protocols.

Nassau contains the following applications:

- [**BinaryFILE Recorder**](applications/binaryfile-recorder) records a
  MoldUDP64 or SoupBinTCP session to a BinaryFILE file.

- [**SoupBinTCP Gateway**](applications/soupbintcp-gateway) serves a MoldUDP64
  session over the SoupBinTCP protocol.

Nassau contains the following test applications:

- [**SoupBinTCP Performance Test**](tests/soupbintcp-perf-test) is a simple
  benchmark for the SoupBinTCP implementation.

- [**BinaryFILE Performance Test**](tests/binaryfile-perf-test) is a simple
  benchmark for the BinaryFILE implementation.


## Build
